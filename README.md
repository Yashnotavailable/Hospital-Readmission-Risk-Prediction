# Hospital-Readmission-Risk-Prediction
🔍 Overview This project focuses on analyzing patient-level hospital data to identify the key factors contributing to 30-day hospital readmissions. By performing in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset, we aim to uncover insights that can help healthcare providers reduce unnecessary readmissions and improve patient care.
